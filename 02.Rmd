## More than a job board

Matching jobs with right candidates has never been an easy task. According to a recent [survey conducted by Society of Human Resource Management](https://www.shrm.org/about-shrm/press-room/press-releases/pages/human-capital-benchmarking-report.aspx), it takes an average of 42 days to fill an open position, with an average cost of $4,129. The existing job boards, most of which use the key-word mapping, are inefficient. For candidates, it is difficult to find positions of interest by searching through keywords (e.g. if you search for data scientist positions, the results are mixed with data base engineer and credit card risk analyst); for recruiters, selecting qualified candidates through piles of resumes is also quite a challenge. Interactive Recruiters will make the old way of search obsolete. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, we aim to help the candidates and jobs find each other.


## How does it work?

We have two types of users: job seekers and recruiters. The goal is to design a classifier based on each userâ€™s profile (education, industry, years of experience, location, etc.) that will help him / her find the suitable positions / candidates. We will rely extensively on Natural Language Processing to capture the features of resumes and job postings. At the early stage, the user still needs to rely on the traditional key-word searching and manually identify positions / resumes of interest. Once there are enough records, the magic happens. We will use algorithms to identify opening positions / candidate profiles the users are likely to be interested in and directly send recommendations to them. The users can react to the recommendations by selecting the ones that match their preferance, the feedback will be further used to refine the prediction. In other words, the more actively a user uses our service, the more precise the prediction is going to become.

Once we have sufficient interactions between job seekers and recruiters, we can start to offer more value-adding services. For candidates, we can share them the important features of candidate profiles that were hired by positions of interest, help them evaluate their own strengths and weaknesses and offer advices on career development and resume writing. For recruiters, we can help them assess the effectiveness of their job posts (e.g. show the profile of candidates who react to their posting to find out if their postings are hitting the targeted candidates) and make suggestions on adjusting requirements and salaries, etc., to help them achieve the hiring objectives.

We will also use anonymous data from direct interactions between candidates and recruiters to improve the prediction, however we will add an option to opt out if there are any privacy concerns.


## Making job hunting a better experience

We aim to build a platform with personalized job searching / candidate screening experience for both candidates and recruiters that offers insights to help them improve their competitiveness. Through lowering down the cost of information retrieval and bridging the gap of information asymmetry between candidates and recruiters, this project will help build a more efficient and transparent job market.
