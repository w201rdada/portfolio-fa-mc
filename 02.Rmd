## More than a job board

Matching jobs with the right candidates has never been an easy task. According to a recent [survey conducted by the Society of Human Resource Management](https://www.shrm.org/about-shrm/press-room/press-releases/pages/human-capital-benchmarking-report.aspx), it takes an average of 42 days to fill an open position, with an average cost of $4,129. Existing job boards, most of which use keyword mapping, are inefficient. For candidates, it is difficult to find positions of interest by searching through keywords (for instance, if you search for data scientist positions, the results are mixed with database engineer and credit card risk analyst positions). For recruiters, selecting qualified candidates through piles of resumes is also a challenge. Interactive Recruiters will make the old way of search obsolete. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, we aim to help candidates and jobs find each other.


## How does it work?

We have two types of users: job seekers and recruiters. The goal is to design a classifier based on each job seekerâ€™s profile (education, industry, years of experience, location, etc.) and each open position that will help recruiters and candidates find each other. We will rely extensively on natural language processing to capture the features of resumes and job postings. In early stages of the product, users will still need to rely on the traditional keyword searching and manually identifying positions or resumes of interest. Once there are enough records, the magic happens. We will use algorithms to identify opening positions and candidate profiles that users are likely to be interested in and send recommendations directly to them. The users then select the ones that match their preference, this feedback will be further used to refine the prediction. In other words, the more actively a user uses our service, the more precise the prediction is going to become.

Once we have sufficient interactions between job seekers and recruiters, we can start to offer more value-adding services. For candidates, we can share with them the important features of the candidate profiles that were hired into similiar positions, help them evaluate their own strengths and weaknesses, and offer advice on career development and resume writing. For recruiters, we can help them assess the effectiveness of their job posts (e.g., show the profile of candidates who react to their posting to find out if their postings are hitting the targeted candidates) and make suggestions on how to adjust requirements and salaries to help them achieve the hiring objectives.

We will also use anonymous data from direct interactions between candidates and recruiters to improve our predictions. However, we will add an option to opt out if users have any privacy concerns.


## Making job hunting a better experience

We aim to build a platform for candidates and recruiters that helps everyone: recruiters and candidates are matched more quickly, candidates get personalized job searching, and recruiters get insights to help them improve their competitiveness. Through lowering the cost of information retrieval and bridging the gap of information asymmetry between candidates and recruiters, this project will help build a more efficient and transparent job market.
