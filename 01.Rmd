## A beginning.

Winter is coming for the active asset managers, due to the rising popularity of low cost ETFs in the recent years. This project aims to bring data science into the active management world to help asset managers generate better returns by predicting the behavior of passively managed funds.

## A middle.

ETFs and passive funds have become popular in recent years, due to the low cost and relatively low risk. Several studies have found that most active funds could not generate higher-than-market return over the long run, let alone the high management fee and tax attached to them. Even if active managers could identify and profit from market inefficiencies from time to time, a perfectly sound and safe strategy could be hindered by market's irrationality and black swan events.

This project is not aimed to identify mispricing or arbitrage opportunities. Instead, the project is aimed to help investors understand the behavior of passive funds, and make predictions over the securities that might be traded in the next rebalancing.

1. Use Natural Language Processing to process the key features of each fund, e.g. what is the investment mandate, the return target and risk appetite? What is the benchmark? How well is the historical tracking record? What is the weighting scheme and how often does the rebalance happen?

2. Retrieve the monthly holdings data for the passive funds (due to the complexity of bond market, I will only focus on equity funds at this time).

3. Based on the rebalancing results, group the securities into three groups (bought, sold, hold). Use machine learning techniques to classify these securities, or try to find the features that can best distinguish them.

4. Train a model to predict the securities and the volume that will be traded in the next rebalance. Take consideration of the trading costs and taxes. 

5. Front run! However, don't lie all your faith in the model. Control your exposures appropriately.


## An end.

I expect this project would help active mangers generate some alpha in the short term. However, just as any other games, whenever a new strategy gains some edge, a counter strategy will come into place sooner or later. Even if there is no counter strategy and this strategy continues to make a lot of profit, it could be easily copied by other investors, which would lead to higher execution cost, lower expected profit, and more dangerously, higher price volatility around balancing periods.

Nevertheless, the tool developed in step 1 & 2 could serve as a powerful tool for investors, educators and researchers to easily get summarized information from a large pool of ETFs and mutual funds.
