In this page, you can learn about the two ideas I have: Interactive Recruiters and Totally Legal Front Runner. Figure .: Hello Benjamin Franklin! Interactive Recruiters Pairing the right job with the right candidate was never easy. With machine learning techniques, interactive recruiters can understand what job seekders and recruiters are looking for, and bring them together. Totally Legal Front Runner This project aims to help active asset management professionals to generate more return by predicting the rebalancing activities of passively managed funds.

According to a recent survey conducted by Society of Human Resource Management, it takes an average of 42 days to fill an open position, with an average cost of $4,129. The existing job boards, most of which use the key-word mapping, are inefficient. For candidates, it is difficult to find positions of interest by searching through keywords (e.g. if you search for data scientist positions, the results are mixed with data base engineer and credit card risk analyst); for recruiters, selecting qualified candidates through piles of resumes is also quite a challenge. Interactive Recruiters will make the old way of search obsolete. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, we aim to help the candidates and jobs find each other. 1.2 How does it work? We have two types of users: job seekers and recruiters. The goal is to design a classifier based on each user’s profile (education, industry, years of experience, location, etc.) that will help him / her find the suitable positions / candidates. We will rely extensively on Natural Language Processing to capture the features of resumes and job postings. At the early stage, the user still needs to rely on the traditional key-word searching and manually identify positions / resumes of interest. Once there are enough records, the magic happens. We will use algorithms to identify opening positions / candidate profiles the users are likely to be interested in and directly send recommendations to them. The users can react to the recommendations by selecting the ones that match their preferance, the feedback will be further used to refine the prediction. In other words, the more actively a user uses our service, the more precise the prediction is going to become. Once we have sufficient interactions between job seekers and recruiters, we can start to offer more value-adding services. For candidates, we can share them the important features of candidate profiles that were hired by positions of interest, help them evaluate their own strengths and weaknesses and offer advices on career development and resume writing. For recruiters, we can help them assess the effectiveness of their job posts (e.g. show the profile of candidates who react to their posting to find out if their postings are hitting the targeted candidates) and make suggestions on adjusting requirements and salaries, etc., to help them achieve the hiring objectives. We will also use anonymous data from direct interactions between candidates and recruiters to improve the prediction, however we will add an option to opt out if there are any privacy concerns. 1.3 Making job hunting a better experience We aim to build a platform with personalized job searching / candidate screening experience for both candidates and recruiters that offers insights to help them improve their competitiveness. Through lowering down the cost of information retrieval and bridging the gap of information asymmetry between candidates and recruiters, this project will help build a more efficient and transparent job market.

["Rebalancing-speculation.html", "2 Totally Legal Front Runner 2.1 Alpha is fading 2.2 How to train your model 2.3 The end", " 2 Totally Legal Front Runner 2.0.0.1 Keywords Machine learning, natural language processing, front-running. 2.1 Alpha is fading ETFs and passive funds have become popular in recent years due to the low cost and good diversification. Several studies have found that the majority of active funds could not generate higher-than-market return over the long run; the high management fee and tax can further decrease investors’ net returns. Even if a skilled active manager could consistently identify and profit from market inefficiencies, the performance could still be hindered by the market’s irrationality and black swan events. This project aims to leverage data science techniques to develop an active trading strategy to help asset managers generate better returns by predicting the behavior of passively managed funds. 2.2 How to train your model This project will help active fund managers understand the behavior of their passive counterparts, predict their trades and earn profit by “front running” them. Due to the complexity of bond market, our project will only focus on equity funds at this time. The detailed steps are listed below. Gather features of target funds’ investment mandate. The features should consider the following questions: What is the investment mandate, the return target and risk appetite? What is the benchmark? How detailed (?) is the historical tracking record? What is the weighting scheme and how often does the rebalance happen? The investment mandate can be retrieved from each fund’s website or through Bloomberg terminal (with a substential subscription fee). Natural language processing techniques can be leveraged to quickly process large numbers of unstructured PDF files. Get the daily / monthly (depending on data availability) position files of each target fund. Compare the position changes and tag the securities that have been bought / sold. Retrieve the features of actively traded securities (segments, historical performance, risk, etc.), e.g. the Russell 3000 universe. Train a model to predict if target funds would buy / sell the securities. Based on the rebalancing results, group the securities into three groups (bought, sold, hold). Use machine learning techniques to classify these securities, then use resampling methods (bootstrap, cross validation) to choose the model with the lowest test error. Determine if the strategy is profitable through simulation. Set up paper portfolios that “front run” the predicted trades. Evaluate the strategy’s P&amp;L, taking into consideration trading cost and taxes. Trade! However, don’t lay all your faith in the model. Always monitor and control your exposures. 2.3 The end This project would help active mangers generate alpha in the short term. However, just as any other game, whenever a new strategy gains some edge, a counter strategy will come into place sooner or later. Even if there is no counter strategy and this strategy continues to make a lot of profit, it could be easily copied by other investors, which would lead to higher execution cost, lower expected profit, and more dangerously, higher price volatility around balancing periods. Nevertheless, the tool developed in step 1 &amp; 2 could serve as a powerful tool for investors, educators and researchers to easily get summarized information from a large pool of ETFs and mutual funds.
